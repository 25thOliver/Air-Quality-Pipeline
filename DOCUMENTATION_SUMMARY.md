sleep 300

# 3. Start capturing screenshots in order
# Follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md sections 1-17
```

**Screenshot Locations:**
- Save all in `screenshots/` folder
- Use PNG format
- Follow naming convention in guide

---

### Step 2: Insert Screenshots into README
**Time Required:** ~15 minutes

**Process:**
1. Open README.md
2. Find each `**📸 INSERT SCREENSHOT:**` marker
3. Replace with: `![Description](screenshots/filename.png)`
4. Verify image loads in preview

**Example Replacement:**
```markdown
# Before:
**📸 INSERT SCREENSHOT: Producer logs showing successful data fetch**

# After:
![Producer logs showing successful data fetch](screenshots/producer-logs.png)
```

---

### Step 3: Create Architecture Diagram
**Time Required:** ~20 minutes
**Tool:** https://app.diagrams.net/ (free)

**What to Include:**
- All 9 components (API, Producer, Kafka, Consumer, MongoDB, Debezium, CDC Topic, Cassandra Consumer, Cassandra)
- Arrows showing data flow
- Labels for topics and operations
- Color coding by layer

**Reference:** SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md - Section "Architecture Diagram Details"

**Save As:** `screenshots/architecture-diagram.png`

---

### Step 4: Test All Links and Commands
**Time Required:** ~20 minutes

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All screenshot links work
- [ ] All code blocks are formatted correctly
- [ ] All commands run without errors
- [ ] All curl commands work
- [ ] UI links open correctly (http://localhost:8083, etc.)

**Test Script:**
```bash
# Test all commands from README
cd air-quality-pipeline

# Test queries
docker exec mongo mongosh -u airflow -p airflow123 --authenticationDatabase admin --quiet --eval "db.getSiblingDB('air_quality_db').air_quality_raw.countDocuments()"

docker exec cassandra cqlsh -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM air_quality_analytics.air_quality_readings;"

# Test API endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:8084/connectors

curl -s http://localhost:8084/connectors/mongo-air-quality-connector/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Test UI access
curl -s http://localhost:8083 | grep -q "kafka-ui" && echo "Kafka UI is accessible"
```

---

### Step 5: Create .gitignore Entry for Screenshots (Optional)
**If screenshots contain sensitive data:**

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
# Screenshots (if they contain sensitive info)
screenshots/*.png
!screenshots/architecture-diagram.png
```

**Otherwise:** Commit screenshots to repo for complete documentation
